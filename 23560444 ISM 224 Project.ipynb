    "This project tasked us with coding a program in Python that enables the user to ask for and recieve information about movies. The program had to integrate most of the techniques explored throughout the course. There were two ways we could create this program. The first method invloved using the Open Movie Database API, while the second method  invloved making use of IMDB and the BeautifulSoup library for web scrapping.\n",

    "## Open Movie Database and RESTful API\n",
    "The OMDb API is a RESTful API that gives user access to movie information via a web service. It is a collaborative database as all the images and content on the website are maintain and contributed by its users.\n",
    "#### What is a RESTful API?\n",
    "Firstly, API stands for Application Programming Interface, and an API is a protocol that sets out how different applications or devices can communication with and connect to each other. A RESTful API, also called a REST API, is one that follows the Representational State Transfer architectual style's design principles. An API allows a user to interact with an application or system by helping communicate the users request in a way the system will understand. REST is not a protocol or set of rules, it is a set or architectural styles or limitations. \n",
    "When a user makes a request using a RESTful API, the API sends a representation of that request back to the user, usually in JSON format, as this format is east for both humans and computers to understand.\n",
    "There are criteria an API must meet to be considered a RESTful API. These criteria are:\n",
    "- a user-server system consisting of users, resources and services, with user requests being managed through HTTP,\n",
    "- no user information is stored between different requests and each request is treated as seperate,\n",
    "- cacheable data in order to make user-server interactions easier and faster,\n",
    "- the data must be uniform so that the requested information is easily identifiable,\n",
    "- the system architecture must be layered, meaning that requests go through different layers and neither end can tell exactly where the data goes, and\n",
    "- an optional criteria is code-on-demand, which means that in some cases, the API can return executable code to the user. This code should then only run on user demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OMDb API is RESTful and therefore allows the user to search its movie database through set functions and returns the results to the user in JSON format. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have used the OMDb RESTful API to create a program that sends user-input through the API, returns the relevant information and is formated in a way that is easy for the user to understand."

However, if without differenciating the check from the print, the output displays twice. By specifing that if the number == 1, I am ensuring that the check (that has a number 0) is not ptinted.

    "### Problems encountered\n",
    "The first issue I experienced was finding a starting point. As someone with little coding experience before this module, I initially struggled with formulating how I could make the code output what I wanted, they way I wanted. At first, I was overwhelmed by how much I thought I did not know. The way I overcame this was by starting with a very basic program. I knew I needed to receive user input, so I started by determining what I would ask the user and how I would like them to respond. From there I used the OMDb API documentation to figure out how I could get the information I needed. Once I had determined those aspects, the program started to build fairly quickly. From my starting point I had to determine how to write to and read text from the text file. To understand how to do this, I read over the textbook and reviewed lecture material. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next obstacle I encountered had to do with how I should treat errors. I knew I had to use `try and except` functions, but it was difficult to determine where they should go. Through trial and error and rerunning my program, I was able to get the program to run without errors from the OMDb API. Next, I had to think of how to counteract user error, such as if the user did not enter 'yes or no' in a 'yes or no' field. I used nested if functions to enter the program would still run with user error.\n",
    "\n",
    "My next problem came with trying to determine how to keep the program running and for it not to stop before the user was ready. I used a `while loop` to keep the program running for the user. However, the loop cannot be infinite and must cose if the user does want it to. This meant determining where to put `breaks` to close the program at the right prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next task I wanted to accomplish was displaying the output in a way that is visually appealing and easy for the user to understand. I made use of \"\\n\" to create new lines and imported html formatting to improve this. I also had to figure out how to write the search history to the text file in a way that would return in the same manner as the rest of the outputs. I also used ANSI escape sequences to emphasise certain parts of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not make use of object-oriented programming because I struggled to understand how it could be implemented into the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue I experienced towards the end of this project wad dealing with an encoding error with my text file. This error caused the program not to be able to write to the text file. I fixed this error by adding a line of code to the variable that appends the search information to the text file. Howver, this later proved to create more issues and has since been removed."

Instead, I would like to have the program to reask the specific search questions;\n",
